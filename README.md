# Technical-Writing-Portfolio
## About Me
I am a writer with a focus on authoring and editing aerospace and defense industry technical documentation. Due to the nature of the subject matter, the provided documents have either been altered to remove sensitive information, or samples have been created. Most of these selections demonstrate my ability to gather technically complex information, identify relevant data and audiences, and create user-friendly documentation. The DITA and RoboHelp samples, however, are included not to highlight my writing but to highlight my proficiency in using these tools and understanding their underlying concepts.
