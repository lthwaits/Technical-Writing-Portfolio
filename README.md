# Technical-Writing-Portfolio
## About Me
I am a writer with a focus on authoring and editing aerospace and defense industry technical documentation. Due to the nature of the subject matter, the provided documents have either been altered to remove sensitive information, or samples have been created. The majority of these selections demonstrate my ability to gather technically complex information, identify relevant data and audiences, and create user-friendly documentation. The [DITA Sample](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lthwaits/Technical-Writing-Portfolio/blob/main/html5/index.html)   however, is included not to showcase my writing but to highlight my proficiency in using this tools and understanding its underlying concepts.
